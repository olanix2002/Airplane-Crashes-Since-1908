At the time this Dataset was created in Kaggle (2016-09-09), the original version was hosted by Open Data by Socrata at the at: https://opendata.socrata.com/Government/Airplane-Crashes-and-Fatalities-Since-1908/q2te-8cvq, but unfortunately that is not available anymore. The dataset contains data of airplane accidents involving civil, commercial and military transport worldwide from 1908-09-17 to 2009-06-08.

While exploring through the data, The following question was asked about the dataset
